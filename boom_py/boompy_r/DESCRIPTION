Description: Provides an R interface to the BOOM Python library for Bayesian 
    statistical modeling. BOOM (Bayesian Object Oriented Modeling) offers a wide 
    range of models including linear regression, generalized linear models, 
    state space models, mixture models, and MCMC samplers. This package uses 
    reticulate to seamlessly integrate the Python implementation with R workflows.
