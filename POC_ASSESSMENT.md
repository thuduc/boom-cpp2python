### How we verified the accuracy of the Implementation Plans
For the Python conversion implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to analyze the current C++ codebase to assess the quality of the Python Implementation Plan ([PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md](PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md)). Here's its response:

⏺ Assessment of C++ to Python Conversion Implementation Plan

  After thoroughly analyzing the BOOM C++ codebase against the Python conversion plan, I estimate the plan is 95% 
  correct.

  Key Findings:

  Strengths (What the plan gets right):
  - Scale: Accurately estimates ~220,000 lines of C++ code (actual: 227,483 lines across 1,393 files)
  - Core Components: Correctly maps all major modules:
    - LinAlg/ → boom/linalg/ (Vector.hpp, Matrix.hpp, SpdMatrix.hpp verified)
    - distributions/rng.hpp → boom/distributions/rng.py
    - Models/ hierarchy with GaussianModel, BinomialModel, PoissonModel, etc.
    - Comprehensive coverage of Samplers/, stats/, numopt/ components
  - Technology Stack: NumPy/SciPy choice is perfect given heavy Eigen usage (73 includes across 42 files)
  - Migration Strategy: Logical phasing from foundation → math → distributions → models
  - Implementation Approach: Direct C++ to Python mapping with NumPy wrappers is practical

  Minor Gaps (5%):
  1. StateSpace complexity (-3%): Underestimates complexity - actual structure has Filters/, Multivariate/, and
  StateModels/ subdirectories with ~100+ files
  2. Test coverage mapping (-2%): Doesn't fully capture the extensive test infrastructure present in each module's
  tests/ directory

  Technical Assessment:
  - The "no premature optimization" principle is wise
  - 24-month timeline appears realistic for manual conversion
  - Risk assessment correctly identifies 5-10x performance hit as acceptable trade-off
  - Phase ordering (math → distributions → models → samplers) follows proper dependency chain

  The plan demonstrates excellent understanding of the codebase architecture and would serve as a strong foundation
  for the conversion project.


### How we verified the accuracy of the coverted Python code
For the Python conversion implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to analyze and verifiy the converted Python code against the Implementation Plan ([PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md](PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md)). Here's its response:

⏺ Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Python implementation in impl-python, I can provide the following quality
  assessment:

  Overall Quality Score: 92%

  Breakdown by Component:

  1. Core Mathematics & Linear Algebra (95%)
    - Clean NumPy wrappers matching BOOM C++ API
    - Comprehensive Vector/Matrix operations
    - Proper handling of special matrices (SpdMatrix)
  2. Distributions (93%)
    - Excellent use of SciPy for standard distributions
    - Custom implementations for specialized distributions
    - R-compatible mathematical functions
  3. Model Framework (94%)
    - Well-designed object-oriented hierarchy
    - Proper abstraction with base classes
    - Clean parameter management and observer patterns
  4. Statistical Models (91%)
    - Thorough implementations with conjugate priors
    - Proper sufficient statistics handling
    - Complete MLE and Bayesian inference methods
  5. MCMC Samplers (90%)
    - Multiple proposal distributions
    - Proper Metropolis-Hastings and slice sampling
    - Good abstraction for extensibility
  6. Advanced Features (88%)
    - Complete HMM with Baum-Welch algorithm
    - Robust Kalman filter implementation
    - Time series models (AR, MA, ARIMA)

  Key Strengths:

  - 100% test pass rate (573 tests)
  - Follows conversion plan principles perfectly
  - Clean, readable code with comprehensive documentation
  - Type hints throughout for better maintainability
  - BOOM C++ API compatibility maintained

  Minor Areas for Improvement:

  - Some optimization algorithms could be more sophisticated
  - Additional mixture models could be implemented
  - More extensive state space model variations

  The implementation successfully achieves the conversion plan's goals of creating a simple, maintainable Python
  version that prioritizes correctness over performance.
