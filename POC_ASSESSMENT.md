### How we verified the accuracy of the Implementation Plans
Note: OpenAI's o3 and o4 LLMs are not known for their coding ability. Same with Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. So we used Opus 4 LLM to independently verify.
For the Python conversion implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to analyze the current C++ codebase to assess the quality of the Python Implementation Plan ([PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md](PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md)). Here's its response:

For the Python conversion implementation, we asked Claude Code (together with Opus 4 LLM) to independently analyze and verifiy the converted Python code against the Implementation Plan ([PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md](PYTHON_CONVERSION_PLAN.md)). Here's its response:
