The 'dynreg' package implmements a sparse dynamic Bayesian regression model.

The main class is a DynamicRegressionModel: a time series regression model where
the coefficients obey a classic state space model.  A "time point" for this
model is a regression data set (X[t], y[t]).  The number of observations may vary
across different values of t, but the variables in X are constant.

The model is y[t] = X[t] * beta[t] + error[t], with error term error[t] ~ N(0,
Diagonal(sigma^2)), where error[t] is independent of error[t'].

The coefficient vector beta[t] has elements beta[j, t].  Let gamma[j, t] = 0 if
beta[j, t] is zero, and gamma[j, t] = 1 otherwise.  Conditional on all previous
gamma values, gamma[j, t] depends only on gamma[j, t-1], with probability
determined by a Markov chain Pr(gamma[j, t] = s | gamma[j, t-1] = r) = q[r, s],
for r, s in {0, 1}.

The conditional distribution of beta[j, t] given beta[j, t-1], and given
that both are nonzero, is normal with mean b_jt = T_ij b_jt-1, and variance
tau^2.

The model is implemented as a multivariate state space model.  Through data
augmentation one can extend this model to most GLM's.  The current
implementation uses a direct Gibbs sampler (see Scott 2002), but more efficient
MCMC sampling schemes are available.
