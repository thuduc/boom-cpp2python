INSTALLATION
===========================================================================
This module needs to be installed from the top level of the BOOM project directory.
From there, type ./install/pyboom

This process moves code around, so if you see a refence in setup.py or a similar
file to a directory that does not appear to exist in the BOOM git repo, don't
freak out.  That directory will most likely be present in the package
distribution.

The package created by the install script is the one to be published on PyPi,
etc.


ORGANIZATION
===========================================================================
This directory branch contains two types of code.
     - Binding code that uses pybind11 to expose BOOM C++ code in python.
     - Module code for python modules designed to be used directly.

The binding code won't necessarily expose every member of a C++ object.  In some
cases NO members will be exposed.  Members can be exposed incrementally as
needed.

The pybind11 docs are online here: https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.
