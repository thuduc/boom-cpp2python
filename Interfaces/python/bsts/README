This is the python version of Steve Scott's "bsts" R library.  bsts stands for
"Bayesian structural time series" -- any other bs being the fault of the
analyst.  A structural time series model has the form

        y[t] = Z[t] @ state[t] + error[t]              # Observation equation
state[t + 1] = T[t] @ state[t] + R[t] * innovation[t]  # Transition equation

The unobserved latent variable state[t] contains components for trend, seasonal
effects, holiday effects, etc chosen by the analyst to capture salient features
of the data being modeled.  Each state component appends a vector to state[t],
appends a similarly sized vector to the coefficient vector Z[t], a block to the
block diagonal matrix T[t], a block to the rectangular "error expander" matrix
R[t], and appends a possibly lower dimensional vector to innovation[t].
