  ## Suggests a burn-in period for an MCMC chain based on the log
  ## likelihood values simulated on the last leg of the chain.
  ## Args:
  ##   log.likelihood: The MCMC sample path of log likelihood for a
  ##     model.
  ##   fraction: The fraction of the chain that should be used to
  ##     determine the log likelihood lower bound.
  ##   quantile: The quantile of the values in the final fraction that
  ##     must be exceeded before the burn-in period is declared over.
  ##
  ## Returns:
  ##   An iteration number to be used as a burn-in.  This can be 0 if
  ##   'fraction' is zero, which will be the case if no burn-in is
  ##   desired.
  ##
  ## Details:
  ##   Look at the last 'fraction' of the log.likelihood sequence and
  ##   find a specified quantile to use as a threshold.  Then return
  ##   the first iteration where log.likelihood exceeds this
  ##   threshold.
