    //     such types can be found in the file

    //     class corresponding to each BOOM class that inherits from
    //     BOOM::PoissonProcess.  The objects in this list must have
    //     one of the following names: * background, primary.birth,
    //     primary.traffic, primary.death, secondary.traffic, secondary.death
    //   io_manager:  The RListIoManager in charge of storing MCMC draws.

    //   A vector of PoissonProcess pointers suitable for use in the
    //   PoissonClusterProcess constructor.
